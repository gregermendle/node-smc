# Node SMC

This node module uses [Apple's SMC subsystem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_Management_Controller) to query the system for the CPU temperature, number of fans and for each of the fans retrieves the current RPM.

**This packages works on OSX only**.

## Installation

```sh
npm install smc
```

## Example

```javascript
var smc = require('smc');

Object.keys(smc.metrics).forEach(function(key) {
  var value = smc.get(key);
  if (value > 0) {
    console.log(key, smc.metrics[key]+':', value);
  }
});

var i, f = smc.fans();

for (i = 0; i < f; i++) {
  console.log('F'+i+'Ac', 'Fan', i, 'RPM:', smc.fanRpm(i));
}
```

On my Macbook Pro this prints out the following:

```

## Credits

Most of the work was done by [SÃ©bastien Lavoie](https://github.com/lavoiesl) in his [osx-cpu-temp](https://github.com/lavoiesl/osx-cpu-temp) code. I just took it and made it into a node module, as it was convenient for me to use it that way.

Additional credit goes to [Hendrik Holtmann](https://github.com/hholtmann), the author of [smcFanControl](https://github.com/hholtmann/smcFanControl) as his code inspired osx-cpu-temp and as I used part of the code of smcFanControl to query the fan speed and format the result.

Make it asynchronous, as currently everything happens synchronously.
